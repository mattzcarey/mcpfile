description: A Production Ready client SDK (coming soon)

import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";
import { Card, Cards } from "fumadocs-ui/components/card";

The McpFile SDK consists of 4 parts which you can use together or separately as you see fit.

## Parser

The parser takes a mcpfile and returns a list of servers and the config to connect to each server.

<Callout type="info">
  This is directly pluggable into the MCP SDK `Client.connect()` function.
</Callout>

```typescript title="example.ts"
import { parser } from "@mcpfile/sdk";

const servers = await parser.parse(".mcp.json");
// Returns array of server configs ready for Client.connect()
```

## Client

This client is essentially an extension to the McpSDK Client. It adds lifecycle hooks and handles authentication and helper methods which don't exist on the MCP SDK Client (_yet_).

<Callout type="warn">
  Lifecycle hooks are currently TBC (to be completed).
</Callout>

```typescript title="example.ts"
import { Client } from "@mcpfile/sdk";

const client = new Client({
  onConnect: () => console.log("Connected"),
  onDisconnect: () => console.log("Disconnected"),
});
```

## Manager

Here we add all the juicy bits that you need for production. It will handle multiple servers connected simultaneously.

```typescript title="example.ts"
import { Manager } from "@mcpfile/sdk";

const manager = new Manager();
await manager.connectAll(".mcp.json");
```

## Router

<Callout type="note">
  Router functionality is currently in development (TBC).
</Callout>
