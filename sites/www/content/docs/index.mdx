description: A standard file format for MCP Clients and Agents to declare MCP Servers
---

import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";
import { Card, Cards } from "fumadocs-ui/components/card";

## TLDR

Stick this in a file with a `.json` extension:

```json title="example.mcp.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server-name": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  The application/agent developer can use the McpFile SDK to connect to the
  servers, manage authentication, get lovely lifecycle hooks and helper methods
  which don't exist on the MCP SDK Client (_yet_).
</Callout>

## Motivation

This came about because every MCP Client (Cursor, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI etc) use a slightly different standard for declaring MCP servers for an agent.

What's more, there is no good standard definition for an MCP client which can be used in production. MCP SDK Client can only connect to one server at a time, there are no lifecycle hooks, you can't dump the state to a file (specifically for durable object hibernation). This causes loads of issues since everyone has to reinvent the wheel.

This project includes both a file format specification and an SDK for use with McpFile. The hope is that this can all be pushed upstream to the official SDK.
