// to do in future. I imagine this will focus on which tools are loaded. so you will do

//  const router = createRouter(client, config)
// router.get( async (request, allTools) => {
//  based on the request we can return  the correct list of tools
// })

//  then somehow we need to give conditions and that determines which tools get loaded. make we even use another llm?
