// our client manager will wrap our client. 
// things we want to add. we want to call 
// manager.connectToMcpFile(filepath)
// manager.getState() to get the state of the manager in json
// otherthings we need. 
// lifecycle hooks: onChange, onError
// dump the state of this class to serializable json (for storage)
// load the state of this class from serializable json (for storage)
// handle multiple servers connected. handle them through the auth flow. 


// i think of the getting and loading from json as simular to pydantic .to_json() and .from_json() etc.
